# Fetal and mother heart rate identification on NI-FECG signals

## Main objective
Develop a deep learning based strategy for the fetal and mother heart rate identification on sintetic NI-FECG signals.

## Main expected outcomes
* A deep neural network design for the fetal and mother heart rate identification on sintetic NI-FECG signals.
* A deep neural network implementation for the fetal and mother hearh rate identification on sintetic NI-FECG signals.
* A set of sintetic NI-FECG signals generated by the PhysioNet simulator
* Publish the research results
