The front end of an ECG must be able to deal with extremely weak signals ranging from 0.5 mV to 5.0 mV, combined with a dc component of up to ±300 mV—resulting from the electrode-skin contact—plus a common-mode component of up to 1.5 V, resulting from the potential between the electrodes and ground.
