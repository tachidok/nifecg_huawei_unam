# In this folder

`my_exp_datagen1.m`: Matlab script to generate database for NI-FECG,
  mECG, fECG signals with their corresponding mQRS and fQRS.
  
`my_clean_crompess.h`: helper Matlab script to reduce the size of the
generated files by the `my_exp_datagen1.m` script. This is a modified
version of the FECGSYN's matlab script to include the `mixture`
(mother and fetus = NIFECG) signal.

# Instructions

In order to generate the database you need to add to the Matlab path
the FECGSYN folder (including all subfolders). Then run the
`my_exp_datagen1.m` script to generate the `*.csv` signal files; these
include:
   * mecg
   * fecg
   * mqrs
   * fqrs
   * nifecg

The resulting files will be stored in the folders:
   * `output_data/baseline`
   * `output_data/heart_rate_variable`

thus make sure to create them before running the script.
   
## More instructions

The file `my_clean_compress.m` reduce the resulting size of the vector
generated by the simulator. If you require the FULL data then comment
the line on the `my_exp_datagen1.m` script that calls the method
`my_clean_compress()`

## Normal heart-rate for fetus

The normal heart-rate for a fetus is about twice the normal adults
heart-rate. It varies according to its week of conception but slowing
to a normal heart-rate in the last 10 weeks of pregnancy.

* Between 110 - 160 bpm with variations by 5 to 25 bpm.
* Between 120 - 160 bpm
* Between 120 - 180 bpm

Tachycardia: When your heart beats too fast, usually more than 100
beats a minute.

Bradycardia: When your heart beats too slowly, below 60 beats a minute.
